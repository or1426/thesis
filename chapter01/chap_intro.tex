\chapter{Introduction and Synopsis}
\label{chap:intro}

In his seminal paper $92$ years ago Heisenberg brought attention to two different, but complementary, forms of uncertainty in quantum mechanics~\cite{Heisenberg1927-Wheeler+Zurek}. The first, which we will call \emph{preparation uncertainty}, refers to the fact that there exist sets of observables for which there are no states which make the probability distributions given by the Born rule simultaneously deterministic for every observable in the set. The standard description (see, for example~\cite{griffiths2005introduction})in textbooks of quantum mechanics of uncertainty follows this approach, generally focusing on the standard-deviation as a measure of the spread of a probability distribution, and exploring a tradeoff forcing one standard-deviation to become large as another becomes small. This idea has been explored and generalised extensively in the literature, for example by using different definitions of the spread of a probability measure~\cites{MaassenUffink1988}{doi:10.1063/1.3614503}{doi:10.1063/1.2759831}. We will explore generalisations of this idea in the first part of this thesis.

In recent years it has become well known that the most famous thought experiment in Heisenberg's 1927 paper does not fit into this preparation focused view of uncertainty, and a new perspective has emerged which we will call \emph{measurement uncertainty}~\cites{PhysRevLett.111.160405}{blw-meas-uncertainty}{6773660Werner:2004:URJ:2011593.2011606}. A feature that separates quantum theory from classical is that quantum theory contains sets of observables for which there does not exist any joint observable, such observables are called \emph{incompatible} and the study of quantum incompatibility is a burgeoning field~\cites{Heinosaari_2016}{PhysRevLett.122.130402}{Heinosaari_2017}{PhysRevA.96.052127}. On the other hand it is possible, for example, to form approximations to the original observables by mixing them with trivial observables\footnote{Those for which the Born rule probability distribution is independent of the state.}, and at some level of mixing these approximations will become compatible~\cite{PhysRevA.87.052125}. We might broaden this view by considering arbitrary sets of compatible observables as approximators and, armed with some measure of the goodness of our approximations, investigate how closely we can approximate the original set.


\section*{Chapter~\ref{chap:low_dim_prep}}

Here we investigate the concept of an uncertainty region, a slight generalisation of the usual concept of an uncertainty relation. We determine the variance-uncertainty region for all pairs, and an infinite family of triples of sharp $\pm 1$ valued observables, the former case has been fully characterised in the literature~\cites{LiQiao2015}{AbbottAlzieuHallBranciard2016}, but we present a new derivation, with a geometrical flavour.

\section*{Chapter~\ref{chap:interferometric_prep_ur}}

Here we consider the preparation uncertainty for ``which-way'' and ``fringe'' observables associated with a particle in an infinite interferometer. We employ the spectral representation of the modular momentum observable introduced by Aharonov, et. al.~\cite{aharonov-modular-variables}, and characterise appropriate observables by their covariance properties. For two natural covariance conditions, we show that optimal observables are equivalent to the canonical observables for a particle on a one dimensional ring, and a one dimensional ``box'', with infinite potential barrier respectively. The uncertainty region for the particle on a ring was characterised by Busch, Kiukas and Werner~\cite{sharp-ur-num-angle}, but the box case has not been addressed in the literature. We obtain upper and lower bounds for the boundary curve of the uncertainty region of the particle in a box, and show that our upper bound is tight for an interval comprising slightly under two thirds\footnote{More precisely $1 - \sqrt{\frac{1}{3} - \frac{2}{\pi^2}} \approx 0.64$} of the possible position variance values.
