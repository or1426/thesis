I would like to thank Paul Busch, who taught me so much, and helped me so much more. Roger Colbeck, for taking over my supervision when Paul no longer could and Stefan Weigert and Leon Loveridge for their patience, sympathy and support during a difficult time for all of us.\\
My research group, Peter Brown, Victoria Wright, Thomas Cope, Mirjam Weilenmann, Vilasini Venkatesh and Giorgos Eftaxias for many discussions, both useful and entertaining.\\
My friends, family, housemates and office-mates, and especially Peter Brown, Mirjam Weilenmann, Nicola Rendell, Allan Gerrard, Lucy Baker, Tom Quinn-Gregson and Rosie Leaman, who made some difficult times easier, and some easy times fantastic.\\
I am indebted to my collaborators, particuarly Jukka Kiukas whose clarity, rigour, patience and mathematical knowledge were critical to the work.\\
I acknowledge the generous support of EPSRC, and the University of York.\\ \\
This thesis is dedicated to the memory of Professor Paul Busch, who I am privileged to have called a mentor, and honoured to have called a friend. \\I will not be your last student.
