For example, we believe that we understand the physical content of Einstein's concept of a closed 3-dimensional space because we can visualize consistently the experimental consequences of this concept. Of course these consequences contradict our everyday physical concepts of space and time. However, we can convince ourselves that the possibility of employing usual space-time concepts at cosmological distances can</p>},

ABSTRACT = {The well-known Robertson–Schrödinger uncertainty relations have state-dependent lower bounds, which are trivial for certain states. We present a general approach to deriving tight state-independent uncertainty relations for qubit measurements that completely characterise the obtainable uncertainty values. This approach can give such relations for any number of observables, and we do so explicitly for arbitrary pairs and triples of qubit measurements. We show how these relations can be transformed into equivalent tight entropic uncertainty relations. More generally, they can be expressed in terms of any measure of uncertainty that can be written as a function of the expectation value of the observable for a given state.},

Significantly, these free parameters depend on neither the state nor the observables. A feature of our method is that any nontrivial bound can always be improved. In addition, we generalize both bounds to uncertainty relations with multiple (three or more) observables, maintaining the uncertainty relations' tightness.

The pioneers of quantum mechanics were acutely aware and puzzled by this fact, and it motivated Heisenberg to seek a mitigation, which he formulated in his seminal paper of 1927. He provided intuitive arguments to show that the values of, say, the position and momentum of a particle can at least be unsharply defined, and they can be measured together provided some approximation errors are allowed. Only now, nine decades later, a working theory of approximate joint measurements is taking shape, leading to rigorous and experimentally testable formulations of associated error tradeoff relations. Here we briefly review this new development, explaining the concepts and steps taken in the construction of optimal joint approximations of pairs of incompatible observables. As a case study, we deduce measurement uncertainty relations for qubit observables using two distinct error measures. We provide an operational interpretation of the error bounds and discuss some of the first experimental tests of such relations.}

 abstract = {In semidefinite programming, one minimizes a linear function subject to the constraint that an affine combination of symmetric matrices is positive semidefinite. Such a constraint is nonlinear and nonsmooth, but convex, so semidefinite programs are convex optimization problems. Semidefinite programming unifies several standard problems (e.g., linear and quadratic programming) and finds many applications in engineering and combinatorial optimization. Although semidefinite programs are much more general than linear programs, they are not much harder to solve. Most interior-point methods for linear programming have been generalized to semidefinite programs. As in linear programming, these methods have polynomial worst-case complexity and perform very well in practice. This paper gives a survey of the theory and applications of semidefinite programs and an introduction to primal-dual interior-point methods for their solution.},

abstract = "Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is usually taken to express a limitation of operational possibilities imposed by quantum mechanics. Here we demonstrate that the full content of this principle also includes its positive role as a condition ensuring that mutually exclusive experimental options can be reconciled if an appropriate trade-off is accepted. The uncertainty principle is shown to appear in three manifestations, in the form of uncertainty relations: for the widths of the position and momentum distributions in any quantum state; for the inaccuracies of any joint measurement of these quantities; and for the inaccuracy of a measurement of one of the quantities and the ensuing disturbance in the distribution of the other quantity. Whilst conceptually distinct, these three kinds of uncertainty relations are shown to be closely related formally. Finally, we survey models and experimental implementations of joint measurements of position and momentum and comment briefly on the status of experimental tests of the uncertainty principle."

Convexity of f is defined with respect to closed cone partial orderings, or more general binary relations, on the range of f. Two different methods of proof are given, one based on geometric properties of convex sets and the other based on the Strong Law of Large Numbers. Various conditions under which Jensen's inequality becomes strict are studied. The relation between Jensen's inequality and Fatou's Lemma is examined."

Incompatibility is a fascinating aspect of physical theories, especially in the case of quantum theory. The concept of incompatibility gives a common ground for several famous impossibility statements within quantum theory, such as ‘no-cloning’ and ‘no information without disturbance’; these can be all seen as statements about incompatibility of certain devices. The purpose of this paper is to give a concise overview of some of the central aspects of incompatibility.}

A noncommutative analogue of Hunt-Stein theorem in mathematical statistics is proved, giving a characterization of the most precise measurements. As examples, measurements of angle, phase and orientation are considered. Rigorous uncertainty relations are obtained in these cases."

abstract="We describe a setup for obtaining uncertainty relations for arbitrary pairs of observables related by a Fourier transform. The physical examples discussed here are the standard position and momentum, number and angle, finite qudit systems, and strings of qubits for quantum information applications. The uncertainty relations allow for an arbitrary choice of metric for the outcome distance, and the choice of an exponent distinguishing, e.g., absolute and root mean square deviations. The emphasis of this article is on developing a unified treatment, in which one observable takes on values in an arbitrary locally compact Abelian group and the other in the dual group. In all cases, the phase space symmetry implies the equality of measurement and preparation uncertainty bounds. There is also a straightforward method for determining the optimal bounds.",

We work out several applications, including the canonical cases of position--momentum, position--energy, number--phase, as well as periodic observables relevant to spatial interferometry. We close the paper with some considerations of complementarity in a noisy setting, focusing especially on the case of convolutions of position and momentum, which was a recurring topic in Paul's work on operational formulation of quantum measurements and central to his philosophy of unsharp reality.",
